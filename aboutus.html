                <p>Secure fame was founded by Roan Smith after he saw the amount of people asking him how he grew his accounts so fast so naturally.</p>

                <p>With the help from online courses and educational videos he was able to build this site and help other Instagram users grow their pages they way he does, natural, organic, and niche related.</p>

                <p>He is currently the only active member/staff that runs the whole business through specialized software to help automate the processes of growing the accounts. He now focuses mainly on advertising the business because everything is in place to grow his clients, he just need to get them to see his service.</p>

                <p>Amazing brands and content creators struggle to get traction and is like an amazing singer who always stays at home, no one knows he/she exists. Without reaching out you may never get found.</p>

                <p>We want to give the small/medium businesses and professionals a fighting chance against those big league brands, we want to help the underdogs.</p>

                <p>That is why we help Instagram creators find a pathway to their right audience in the most cost effective way. We pride ourselves in delivering results to over 100 Instagram users who struggle to get noticed and reach their target audience.</p>
